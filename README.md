# SolarFlow-Hoymiles-Integration-for-Home-Assistant
Description: This code is tailored for integration with a Zendure SolarFlow Hub 1200, accompanied by an AB2000 Battery and two solar panels each with a capacity greater than 400 Wp. Its primary function is to prioritize battery charging, ensuring that energy storage is maximized before any excess is directed elsewhere. The automation is executed within Home Assistant, which is configured to control a Hoymiles inverter via Open DTU, facilitating a seamless connection and operational efficiency.

It is crucial for users to customize the specified values in the code to suit their specific system's requirements and energy goals, as this script is intended to serve as a template that provides a foundational structure for the automation. This project is a work in progress, and users are encouraged to modify and enhance it as needed to suit their evolving requirements.

Users should implement this code with caution, understanding that it is their responsibility to adjust and validate it according to their setup. The author does not take responsibility for any discrepancies, inefficiencies, or potential damages resulting from the use of this automation. Thorough testing within your own environment is recommended to ensure the automation's effectiveness and safety before fully integrating it into your energy management system.
